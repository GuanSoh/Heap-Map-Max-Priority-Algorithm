# Heap-Map-Max-Priority-Algorithm

This project is use to examine the total time of insert(Enqueue) and remove(Dequeue) different size of element to/from the Heap Map(Data Structure). When the program been executed, the system will 
retrieve the element form the selected file and Enqueue to the Heap Map. After that, system will dequeue 10% of elements from the Heap Map. Total time of Enqueue and Dequeue will
be recorded.

### There are three file been provided:

* set_A: Total 100 elements
* set_B: Total 100000 elements
* set_C: Total 500000 elements
